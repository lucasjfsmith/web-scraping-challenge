 From the https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html homepage, store titles and preiviews in a list of dictionaries and export them to a json file called 'mars_news_outfiles.json' within the 'outfiles' directory

## Part 2
Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, convert it to a pandas DataFrame, and answer the following questions:

* How many months exist on Mars?
* How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
* What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
* Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?

Finally, export the DataFrame as 'mars_weather_data.csv' to the 'outfiles' directory.
